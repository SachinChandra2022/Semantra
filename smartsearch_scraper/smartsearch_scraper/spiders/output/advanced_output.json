Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorization is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritization of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity.

In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.

Also, it protects only the content of the email, and not metadata—an untrusted party can still observe who sent an email to whom.

There is currently no legal definition in the American law that explicitly grants humans the right to privacy.", " Oftentimes, the ", " is utilized by people in court cases to defend themselves from actions that involve certain infringements upon their privacy, such as searches that require warrants.", " However, over the years, the ", " has found it difficult to determine an impartial non-biased meaning for \"expectation of privacy\" because there are too many subjective variables to consider.", "\n", "In line with the general meaning of \"expectation of privacy,\" student expectation of privacy refers to a student's inherent right to privacy in the school system.", " Examples of student expectation of privacy, especially in the pre-collegiate levels, include the protection of a student's academic record from being viewed by anyone other than the academic instructor, the student's parents or guardians, and the students themselves. There have been many legal cases regarding the privacy concerns of pupils' academic records, for example the ", " that was handled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. This particular case began in October 1998 when Kristja J. Falvo filed a lawsuit against the Owasso Independent School District on the premise that the grading practice employed in her children's classroom, peer grading, was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of FERPA. Additionally, peer grading embarrassed her children in front of their peers, which could be interpreted as a violation of a student's expectation of privacy in the classroom. When the case reached the ", ", it was ruled in October 2000 that peer grading was not a violation of the constitutional Fourteenth Amendment but was, in fact, a violation of FERPA. The Tenth Circuit judges reasoned so by closely interpreting the statue in FERPA about privacy protection of \"educational records.\" Since it was agreed upon that teacher grade books were considered \"educational records,\" the Tenth Circuit decided that anything that went into these grade books, including student grades written on student work, were also considered \"educational records\" and thus subject to FERPA's privacy protection policies. After the court decision was released, peer grading practices were banned in school districts within the Tenth Circuit regional borders.", "\n", "Many citizens and scholars were opposed to the Tenth Circuit's decision, and the case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001. In 2002, the Supreme Court Justices officially ruled that peer grading was not a violation of FERPA. They reasoned that student grades on student work were not considered \"educational records\" until the teacher had physically recorded the grades into a grade book.", " Thus, peer grading returned as a common grading practice in classrooms across the United States.\n", "Other examples of student expectation of privacy include the right of children to withhold personal information from teachers within a traditional classroom setting. Such topic remains as a contentious educational privacy concern in the classroom.", " Some argue that teachers should know more information about students in order to help support them in their academic endeavors. Others argue that teachers should refrain from prying into the personal lives of children because, like adults, children should have the right to privacy and determine the amount of information that they reveal to teachers. Still others make the claim that children are too young to make this decision for themselves and should consult their parents prior to revealing anything personal to their teachers.", "\n", "Related to the 4th amendment, students expect to have the privacy to learn in their own homes without being monitored by the teacher or by other non-family members. Educational privacy can go beyond privacy of academic records into the privacy of discussing freely topics at school without being judged or notified by a teacher, and the privacy of physical movements around school and within school proximities. Students at different age level and grade level expect different degrees of freedom of expression and privacy. The level of privacy needed by students and educational facilities also vary by school districts, states, geographical locations, and demographics of school population (including teachers, faculties, researchers, students, etc).\n", "Student educational records, according to the FERPA statute, is defined as \"those records, files, documents, and other materials which--(i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\"", "\n", "The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 was propelled by New York Senator James Buckley who promoted the importance of protection and privacy of educational records of students who attended primary and secondary schooling. As a federal legislation, FERPA grants students under the age of 18 and their parents the right to manage their educational records, which may include data about their academic performance, medical information, behavioral analysis, and more. Thus, when parents or guardians feel that their children's educational records have been exposed to the public in some way, they are able to file claims against the school district as a violation of FERPA.", "\n", "For students over the age of 18, particularly those enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, FERPA can be vague and unclear about the disclosure of educational records to parents. Since individuals aged 18 and over are recognized as adults by the law, FERPA separates students in postsecondary education and their parents in terms of access to educational records such as health and drug records.", " According to Baker, many controversial issues may arise. For example, Baker writes that \"FERPA regulation 99.31(a)(8) allows disclosure to parents without the student's prior written authorization if the student is 'dependent' on the parents as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.\"", " However, there may be circumstances under which financially dependent students would not want their private records accessed by their parents.", " Additionally, FERPA authorizes the release to parents or guardians of information about recorded drug or alcohol use by students under the age of 21. If the underage and illegal drug or alcohol use resulted in legitimate concerns and disciplinary action, school administrators can notify and disclose details to parents without the students' permission.", "\n", " applies to programs and activities of state education agencies that receive funding from the ", ".

According to Stacie Hunt, the Common Core system creates a large student database that keeps track of student performance and information from pre-K to college and even beyond. Federal government and other agencies are able to gain access to this database, analyze student data records, and sell pertinent information to the schools and districts overall. This creates a privacy concern about student data being spread and utilized by third-parties without the students', or their parents', explicit permission.", "\n", " (\"edtech\") is an emerging field in the area of education. According to Dylan Peterson, \"edtech represents a broad category of educational products and services used in schools and by private individuals.\"", " Privacy concerns surround the fact that large amounts of data of each student using edtech are collected and stored in a wide database that can be accessed by schools. This data may be personal to the students and they may not wish for others to view it. However, edtech companies claim that without storing as much student data as possible, it would be more difficult to create programs that effectively address the students' educational needs.", " More and more educators are using technology, and it is likely to grow to the point where advanced technologies can be representative of all educational settings.", " This implies that every educator will eventually need to be aware of the use of technology, and be mindful of what the technology captures and whether it stores learners' personal data.", "\n", "More researchers have found that improving education is an important value for society, as is the protection of the privacy of students. The opportunities that ", " offer are immense, as it has been proven to be able to make essential connections that allow for improvements in the system. However, the negative uses of data can impact the learning of students, as well as their ability to develop socially.", "\n", "To help improve programs that benefit the educational experience of students with disabilities, some scholars propose a digitalized database of student records that are updated in real time.", " This is so that educators can keep track of important information about students with various disabilities and monitor their academic performances for educational purposes.", " While these scholars support the idea of disclosure of data of students with disabilities, they make it very clear that strong legislation and policies must be enforced to protect the privacy of such data. It is currently a debate whether or not digitalized student data that can be accessed by many parties is really beneficial to support individuals with disabilities in school. Some are not comfortable with the idea that the data is updated frequently and disseminated widely, while others believe that the acquisition of such data is necessary to improve programs and enrich educational experiences.", "\n", "Since the 1970s, the commonly held perspective was that the right to privacy was an evaluation of individual worth. Further, ", ", even before the ", ", was perceived as having potentially negative effects such as allowing information to be breached.", " Yet, there were not many violations warranted that would urge legislation to act and shift their attention to protecting privacy in education or primarily individual privacy in general. Technology was also viewed as a source to uncover values, behaviors, motives and thoughts but at the same time, many thought that only qualified professionals had access to personal data.", " However, specifically in higher education, there was a perspective that individuals were susceptible to having their information breached. Thus, the role of education in the 1970s was viewed as one that safeguarded its students and staff to ensure privacy and prevent data from being breached given the technology that existed.\n", "In many public and private colleges and universities across the United States, enrolled students typically live on campus in college-operated ", ". Since students live in these dormitories for the duration of about one year, many personalize and consider their dormitory rooms as their personal and personalized living space.", " However, these dormitories are property owned by colleges and often students must waive their right to privacy for college representatives to conduct searches for safety purposes. While some believe that dormitory searches are effective for maintaining a safe community on campus, others believe that these searches are a violation of student privacy. Many cases have been filed by students in which they were caught with illegal substances in their dormitories during searches that these students felt were an invasion of their private living spaces.", " Additionally, only public or government-related searches with warrants are protected under the Fourth Amendment. Oftentimes college dormitory searches would be regarded as private searches and thus undergo lawsuits that claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment.", " For example, in the case ", ", a Resident Assistant at the New Hampshire Technical Institute searched a student's room on multiple occasions even though the student was not present in the room at all times. Once the Resident Assistant found marijuana in the room, the student was arrested for possessing illegal substances on college campus property. The student then filed a lawsuit against the Resident Assistant on the grounds that the searches were private and thus violated his Fourth Amendment right to protection from private searches. However, the court concluded that the Resident Assistant's employment status rendered him as a government agent and thus his searches were conducted on behalf of the college, a government-related institution.", "\n", "Within social networks, or particular websites that enable the sharing of information as well as communication among individuals, there exists a level of privacy that students prefer to keep their personal information or social life private from school personnel or faculty in order to avoid context collapse.\n", "Technology enables the creation of one's own social presence through informal settings as well as formal settings that allow for the connection of student and instructors for academic purposes.", " Students in higher education using Facebook typically censor or block their information from instructors.

Much of the confusion originated from the fact that the SIS and GCSB appeared to have differing objectives which meant that, if required, co-operation and coordination would likely be complex and convoluted.\n", "For example, only the SIS could perform surveillance, or spy, on New Zealanders, as provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. There were stipulations as to what 'spy-activities' were permitted, and as a pre-requisite, any proposed surveillance had to be relevant to \"security\" and its associated threats, such as instances of 'espionage, sabotage, subversion or terrorist attacks'.", "\n", "In September 2012, ", ", the ", " advised ", ", the then New Zealand Prime Minister, of a situation which would later be called an \"unlawful interception\" of an individual known as ", " by the GCSB.", " Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request.", " However, as the GCSB did not have the legal authority to conduct surveillance, Justice Gilbert of ", ", deemed unlawful.", "\n", "Following this widely publicised incident, ", " and Chief Executive of the ", " Andrew Kibblewhite initiated a review of compliance.", " They assigned the then Cabinet Secretary ", " with undertaking the review to look into the \"activities, systems and processes since 1 April 2003\".", " This date is significant as it was the date from which the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 came into force.\n", " ultimately concluded that GCSB lacked the legal basis and authority to perform many of its intelligence acts – including the surveillance carried out on Kim Dotcom. The Kitteridge Report made a number of recommendations to ensure that the Government agency had the legal authority to do the activities necessary.

One of the prominent issues identified was that the fragmented legislative landscape meant that it was difficult to bring the multiple agencies together when required.  Because each intelligence and security agency operated under its own legislative framework, it was confusing for New Zealanders to understand which agency was responsible for what, and exactly what their lawful powers and capabilities were.\n", "The reviewers concluded that a \"single Act\" was necessary to overcome these issues.", " They commented that a single Act would:\n", "\"give a comprehensive and much clearer view of the agencies' functions and powers, and the checks and balances that apply to the operation of their powers … [and] would avoid inconsistencies and gaps between various statutes and enable a consistent set of fundamental principles to be applied to the agencies and their oversight\".", " ", "Understandably, drawing the two bodies together would make it easier for them to co-operate and work together when required.\nAnother issue concerning to the reviewers was the lack of security protection available to New Zealanders under the prevailing legislation. The most recent piece of legislation dealing with intelligence and surveillance was enacted some 47 years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. Over the course of those years and the accompanying advances in technology, the need to overhaul the law has increased markedly. As terrorist groups continue to advance in their technological capabilities, the current legislation was quickly becoming out-dated and unsuitable for present day society.\n", "The purpose of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 was to bring clarity and cohesion to the GCSB and SIS, the two agencies in New Zealand responsible for monitoring the country's security and intelligence.\n", "The Act was \"a direct response to the report of the First Independent Review of Intelligence and Security in New Zealand: Intelligence and Security in a Free Society, and it replaces the four Acts that applied to the GCSB, the NZSIS, and their oversight bodies\".", "\n", "Given the importance of this proposed legislation, when public submissions for the Bill were called for, 92 were received by the Select Committee.

The basis for doing so was that New Zealand's national security is at stake with the ever-present and increased risk of terrorism in today's society.", "\n", "The new Act has extended the GCSB's capabilities to perform surveillance on New Zealanders, whereas previously, only the SIS was permitted do this. This extension of the GCSB's powers has the potential to have serious ramifications for all New Zealanders, as author and associate professor of law Stephen Penk notes, \"surveillance of an individual may lead to a loss of privacy through an individual’s loss of control or autonomy when, typically, he or she is subjected to undesired monitoring of his or her functions, movements or communications\"", "\n", "As per the recommendations made by Cullen and Reddy the new Act covers a number of points such as:\n", "The Act's purpose was expressed in Section 3; which is to \"protect New Zealand as a free, open, and democratic society\".", " This is achieved by:\n", "b.

The right has also been expressed in many other human rights instruments, such as Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also upholds this right.
